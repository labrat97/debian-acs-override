# ACS Override Patch

A common use case in virtualization is the need to passthrough a PCI or VGA device to a guest VM. However, because all devices within a single IOMMU group must be passed through at once, it can pose challenges to passthrough if there are multiple devices in the same IOMMU group.

To address the issue, Alex Williamson created a kernel patch that allows each device to be placed into its own IOMMU group, easing passthrough:

[https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/30/513](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/30/513)

This repository provides patch files for various kernel versions from 4.10 and updates when a new kernel release breaks patch compatibility.

Note: The ACS override patch is typically considered a 'last resort' for PCIe passthrough if other methods don't work. It's not meant for production systems (and neither are custom kernels), but may be useful for dev environments or homelabs.

## Installation

### Confirm Current IOMMU Groups

Run the iommu-groups.sh helper script to view the current IOMMU groups:

```sh
# ./iommu-groups.sh
...
IOMMU Group 2:
	00:08.0 Host bridge [0600]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir PCIe Dummy Host Bridge [1022:1632]
	00:08.1 PCI bridge [0604]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir Internal PCIe GPP Bridge to Bus [1022:1635]
	00:08.2 PCI bridge [0604]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir Internal PCIe GPP Bridge to Bus [1022:1635]
	05:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Renoir [1002:1636] (rev d8)
	05:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Device [1002:1637]
	05:00.2 Encryption controller [1080]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Family 17h (Models 10h-1fh) Platform Security Processor [1022:15df]
	05:00.3 USB controller [0c03]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir USB 3.1 [1022:1639]
	05:00.4 USB controller [0c03]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir USB 3.1 [1022:1639]
	05:00.6 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Family 17h (Models 10h-1fh) HD Audio Controller [1022:15e3]
	06:00.0 SATA controller [0106]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] FCH SATA Controller [AHCI mode] [1022:7901] (rev 81)
...
```

In the above example, two USB controllers and two PCI bridges are in the same group.

### Build the Kernel Source

In this example we'll build the Kernel into the Debian .deb file format for installation.

```sh
# ./build-debian.sh
```

### Install the Kernel

```sh
# ls *.deb
linux-headers-6.3.0-acso_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb  linux-image-6.3.0-acso-dbg_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb
linux-image-6.3.0-acso_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb    linux-libc-dev_6.3.0-1_amd64.deb
# dpkg -i *.deb
# reboot
```

### Boot System Using the New Custom Kernel

```sh
# vi /etc/default/grub
```

Add `pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` entry like so:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction"
```

### Update GRUB

```sh
# update-grub
# reboot
```

Confirm the grub config updates are applied:

```sh
# cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-6.3.0-acso root=UUID=0706649e-a7c1-4631-973f-cd650f863f00 ro quiet splash systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0 amd-pstate=active pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction vt.handoff=7
```

### Confirm Devices Separated

Run the iommu-groups.sh script again to confirm devices are now separated as expected:

```sh
# ./iommu-groups.sh

## PCI passthrough

Now the patch has been applied to the kernel and the USB controller, for example, is in its own group we can pass it through to the virtual machine.

```sh
IOMMU Group 18:
	05:00.3 USB controller [0c03]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD] Renoir USB 3.1 [1022:1639]
```

```sh
# vi /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

```
install xhci-pci echo vfio-pci >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:05:00.3/driver_override; echo 0000:05:00.3 >/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind; modprobe -i xhci-pci
```

```sh
# update-initramfs -u
# reboot
```
